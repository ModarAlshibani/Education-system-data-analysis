Education System – Data Analysis Project
This project analyzes survey data from schools  to uncover relationships between school types, stakeholder engagement, and school performance metrics. It uses Python and data visualization to deliver clear insights for educators, policy makers, and data scientists.  
  
Dataset Overview  
The dataset includes:  
•	School details (name, type)    
•	response rates from:    
       o	Parents  
       o	Teachers  
       o	Students  
•	Performance metrics covering:    
       o	Safety & Respect  
       o	Communication  
       o	Engagement  
       o	Academic Expectations  
              
 Project Objectives  
•	Clean the data  
•	Handle missing values appropriately based on context  
•	Explore participation patterns by school type  
•	Visualize correlations between engagement and performance  
•	Give recommendations for improvement  
  
Key Analyses    
•	Distribution of school types and participation levels  
•	Missing data handling logic:  
   o	Student responses in Early Childhood: filled with 0  
   o	Few missing values in Middle Schools: filled with group mean  
   o	Many missing values in Elementary Schools: excluded from analysis  
•	Comparison of response rates across school types  
•	Analysis of academic expectations and overall performance  
•	Correlation heatmaps  
•	Scatter plots     
  
Tools Used  
•	Python  
•	Pandas  
•	NumPy  
•	Seaborn  
•	Matplotlib  
•	Jupyter Notebook
